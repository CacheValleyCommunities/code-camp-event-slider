# WebSocket Server Configuration for Event Slider
# 
# For Coolify/HTTPS deployments, set VITE_WSS_SERVER to your WebSocket server URL
# If not set, the system will auto-detect based on the current hostname

# Example for Coolify deployment (replace with your actual domain):
# VITE_WSS_SERVER=wss://your-domain.com:8081

# Example for local HTTPS testing:
# VITE_WSS_SERVER=wss://localhost:8081

# Example for custom WebSocket server:
# VITE_WSS_SERVER=wss://ws.example.com:8081

# For local development, leave this commented out to use auto-detection
# VITE_WSS_SERVER=
